                        Niki is student of full stack web development, with a love for learning, good coffee, and code! Niki began her coding journey very early on (MySpace days) in the mid-2000s. She was also very interested in photography, film, and graphic design - and decided to pursue her Bachelor's Degree at Ryerson University in Toronto, studying Graphic Communications Management. In this program, she had the opportunity to learn about the graphic design, commercial printing, and packaging industries. She took a couple of courses during this time to brush up on her coding skills (HTML/CSS/JS).

                    <p class="media-p2">
                        Her first job in the industry was as a Project Coordinator Intern at Jar Creative in Toronto, at that time it was primarly a web development agency, where she was exposed to small agency structure (many hats, yay!) as well as the project management side. Following this, she spent 3 years working for Schawk (a division of SGK) as a Client Coordinator for graphic design and prepress for packaging and advertising. This opportunity allowed her to further pursue her interests in project management and client relations by acting as a gate keeper between the client and production.

                    <p class="media-p3">
                        In 2017, Niki joined the Loblaw Brands team as Assistant Packaging Manager, where she was responsible for data integrity around the company's product and packaging line. She also had an opportunity to work with printers managing the Loblaw Brand Printer program, collaborating with the sourcing and procurement teams. During her last year at Loblaw, she joined the PLM (Product Lifecycle Management Team) where she was involved in the UX and development of a new system to manage the product lifecycle from conception to production launch.
