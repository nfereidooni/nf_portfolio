# NF_portfolio

## Description 

The goal of this project was to create a professional portfolio website that:
* Includes three pages: About Me, Portfolio and Contact
* Uses responsive design and imagesto trender well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes
* Includes a navigation bar and footer
* Uses bootstrap for design components and grid system

## About Me Page

I created a preliminary About Me page for my portfolio. Within it, I included the following:
* Page header
* An image of myself with a circle shape
* Placeholder text (lorem ipsum) until my bio is completed

## Portfolio Page

I also created a preliminary Portfolio page, which will eventually include samples of my work. Within it, I included the following:
* Page header
* 5x 350x350px placeholder images

## Contact Me Page

I also created a preliminary Contact Me page. Within it, I included the following:
* Page header
* A contact form (I added some Javascript code to check that all the fields are complete when submitting & that the email format is valid. I also included a preliminary PHP file which will be used to submit the form.)

## Common Elements

Navbar:
The navbar was created to be responsive and turns into a toggle bar when in mobile size. I had to debug and insert the jquery source to get this to work correctly.

Footer:
The footer was created to match the style of the navbar.
